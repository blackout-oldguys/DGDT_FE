# Sperm Nest - README

## Introduction

Welcome to **SPERM NEST**, an innovative platform designed and developed during the **BLACKOUT Hackathon** by the **포항공대 뒷방늙은이** team. This project combines blockchain technology and use case with an intuitive interface to create a transparent and efficient donor registry system.

## About the Project

**Sperm Nest** addresses the need for a secure, immutable, and transparent way to manage sperm donor information. By leveraging blockchain technology, our platform ensures data integrity, privacy, and accessibility for authorized users. 

### Key Features
- **Decentralized Donor Registry**: Immutable records of donor information stored on the blockchain.
- **Donor Transparency**: Detailed donor profiles with comprehensive medical, physical, and genetic information.
- **Secure Transactions**: Ethereum-based smart contracts ensure secure and efficient operations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Responsive and intuitive UI designed for seamless user experience.

## How It Works

1. **Donor Registration**  
   - Donors provide their personal, medical, and physical information.  
   - Data is validated and securely stored on the blockchain.  

2. **Smart Contract Automation**  
   - All operations are handled via Ethereum smart contracts for security and trustless execution.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, ethers.js
- **Hosting**: AWS
- **Development Tools**: Vite, Nodit API
